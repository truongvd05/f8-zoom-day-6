                  Your resume should be no longer than 1-2 pages. Keep it to 1
                  page if you have less than 8 years of professional work
                  experience. lf you have more, you might consider using 2
                  pages.

                <li>
                  Include a skills section — it's incredibly important. This
                  step will prove highly valuable if the company uses ATS
                  (applicant tracking system).

                  Unless otherwise specified by the company or the job
                  description, submit your resume in pdf format. You can convert
                  this file to pdf in google docs by going to File, select
                  Download, and then pdf.

                  Write 2-5 bullet points for each position, depending on the
                  duration and relevance of the position. Keep sections that are
                  less relevant to the job you”re applying to short.

                  lts not enough to describe what you have done or your areas of
                  responsibility, you need to quantify the impact of your work.
                  Recruiters scan resumes for numbers, so quantify as much as
                  you can. You can talk about xx% improvement your initiatives
                  yielded.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Or you could mention the increase in company revenue of xx%
                  that your work contributed to.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Avoid writing bullet points that are longer than 2 lines. No
                  recruiter will read bullet points that are as long as
                  paragraphs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Carefully review your resume several times to eliminate any
                  typos. Additionally, consider having someone else proofread it
                  to prevent sending an imperfect resume.

                  Be consistent with grammar. Generally, resumes should be
                  written in the past tense. The exception is if you re
                  describing your current position with ongoing
                  responsibilities.

                <li>
                  lf you have 5-8 years of work experience, do not include
                  internship experience in your resume unless highly relevant.
